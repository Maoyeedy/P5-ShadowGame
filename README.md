# [ðŸŽ® Play the Game!](https://maoyeedy.github.io/P5-ShadowGame/)

*The game is for a 24-hour gamejam, and is still in progress.*

I'm completely new to [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and I'm learning as I go.

I have to admit that it's pretty painful to setup collision without [p5play](https://http://p5play.org/).

### Reference

- [Felix the Reaper](https://store.steampowered.com/app/919410/Felix_The_Reaper/), where player can rotate the sun for 90 degrees.
- [Shadow Puppy Shenanigans](https://prabby-patty.itch.io/shadow-puppy-shenanigans), where player push blocks, and let the blocks' shadow do something.
